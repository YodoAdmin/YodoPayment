This application, the Yodo mobile application, constitutes an anonymous pre-paid mobile money service. The service allows users to create an online stored value cash account, not to exceed a maximum balance of three-hundred US dollars or foreign value equivalency.  Default currency for each account created remains fixed and is set by the currency of the first cash tender. Account funds are linked to your handset and access is controlled by multi-factor authentication including a biometric identity token and a personal identity phrase (PIP) which you provide.  By choosing to use this Yodo mobile application and the mobile money service provided you agree to the following terms and conditions:

<ul>
<li><div align="justify"> No personal information is provided to or stored by the Operator when self registering an account. Pre-paid funds are therefore stored in an anonymous user account associated with your mobile handset rather than to you as an individual or to a third party bank instruments you posses. You assume all risk of loss of funds resulting from the theft or loss of your mobile handset.</div><br><br>

<li><div align="justify"> The Yodo mini-payment system does not constitute a banking service and funds placed in your Yodo stored value account are pre-paid expenditures not cash deposits. Funds stored in your online account are not covered by deposit insurance and you agree not to allow a balance greater than an amount you could reasonably afford to lose to be stored in your account. You further agree that such funds may only be spent at participating merchants or be transferred to other Yodo users and that the Operator need not provide a cash surrender value.</div><br><br>

<li><div align="justify"> The Operator is committed to preventing the Yodo mini-payment system from being used for money laundering, terrorist financing, or other criminal activity.  You agree not to use the Yodo mini-payment system in furtherance of any such activity and you further agree and acknowledge that Yodo may share information concerning your account with law enforcement agencies in connection with any legitimate investigation conducted by any such agency.</div><br><br>

<li><div align="justify"> Loss or unauthorized use of your mobile phone and/or your PIP may cause forfeiture of stored value funds, for which you agree to hold the Operator harmless. You agree to exercise due diligence in the use and sharing of security tokens and PIP phrases to protect the integrity of the Yodo mini-payment system and to undertake to avoid actions which may result in a breach of system security at all times.</div><br><br>

<li><div align="justify"> The Internet Cloud Computing infrastructure upon which the Operator provides this service has been designed with industry best practices for security, fault tolerance, and data loss prevention. There remains, however, the possibility of irrecoverable system failure and irretrievable data loss. You agree to hold the Operator harmless for losses you may suffer due to catastrophic system failure, defined herein as loss of stored value due to major computer system or Internet failure. You also agree to hold the Operator harmless for losses due to third-party fraud, defined herein as fraudulent loss of stored value due to criminal activities by other than the Operator, its registered Merchants and/or their respective Agents.</div><br><br>

<li><div align="justify"> Stored value funds in user accounts which have remained inactive, being defined as the absence of a purchase or a transfer of stored value funds for a period of 24 months, are subject to forfeiture. All forfeited funds, minus a reasonable administrative fee, will be donated to a charitable organization selected by the Operator.</div>
