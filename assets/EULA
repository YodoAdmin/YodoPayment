Yodo's mobile location based services include an anonymous mobile payment service. This service allows you to create an online stored value account linked to your mobile handset and managed by Yodo the Operator. By choosing to use our mobile services you agree to the following terms and conditions:

<ul>
<li><div align="justify"> Access to stored funds is controlled by the Operator using hardware authentication plus a personal  identity phrase (or PIP) which serves to identify online accounts with a user's mobile handset rather than the user themselves.  Should you choose to keep your account anonymous by not sharing additional personal information with the Operator when registering your account, or choose to over-ride the PIP requirement when making a transaction, then you warrant to the Operator that you assume the risk of losses due to unauthorized payments and/or difficulties in fund recovery upon lost of the mobile handset.</div><br><br>

<li><div align="justify"> The Yodo payment system does not constitute a banking service and therefore funds in your Yodo stored value account are pre-paid expenditures not cash deposits. Funds in your account are not covered by deposit insurance and you agree not to allow a balance greater than an amount you could reasonably afford to lose to be stored in your account. You further agree that such funds may only be spent at participating Yodo merchants and/or be transferred to other Yodo users and therefore have no cash surrender value.</div><br><br>

<li><div align="justify"> The Operator is committed to preventing the Yodo payment system from being used for criminal activity such as money laundering, terrorist financing, or for the purchase of unlawful goods or services.  You agree therefore not to use the Yodo payment system in furtherance of any such activity and you further agree and acknowledge that Yodo may share information concerning your account with law enforcement agencies in connection with any legitimate investigation conducted by any such agency when so requested.</div><br><br>

<li><div align="justify"> Loss or unauthorized use of your mobile phone and/or your PIP may cause forfeiture of stored value funds, for which you agree to hold the Operator harmless. You agree to exercise due diligence in the use and sharing of security tokens and PIP phrases to protect the integrity of the Yodo payment system and to undertake to avoid actions which may result in a breach of system security at all times.</div><br><br>

<li><div align="justify"> Yodo's cloud computer support infrastructure is designed using industry best practices for security, privacy and data loss prevention. The possibility remains, however, for irrecoverable system failure and irretrievable data loss. You agree to hold the Operator harmless for losses you may suffer due to system failure, defined herein as loss of stored value due to major computer system or Internet failure. You also agree to hold the Operator harmless for losses due to third party fraud, defined herein as fraudulent loss of stored value due to criminal activities by other than the Operator, its registered Merchants and/or their respective Agents.</div><br><br>

<li><div align="justify"> Stored value funds in online accounts which have remained inactive, being defined as the absence of a purchase or a transfer of stored value funds, for a period of 24 months, are subject to forfeiture. All forfeited funds, minus a reasonable administrative fee, will be donated to a charitable organization selected by the Operator.</div>
